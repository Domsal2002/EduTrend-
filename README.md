# Machine Learning Analysis of Academic Performance

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and predict academic performance at Salem State University. Using historical grade data across various programs, the study employs linear regression to predict lower grades based on higher grades and K-means clustering to identify patterns in academic performance.

## Project Overview

### Objectives

- **Predict Lower Grades**: Utilize linear regression to forecast the occurrence of lower grades (D's and F's) based on higher grades (A's, B's, and C's).
- **Cluster Academic Programs**: Employ K-means clustering to group academic programs based on similar patterns in grade distributions.

### Methods

- **Linear Regression**: Predictive modeling to understand relationships between different grade achievements.
- **K-means Clustering**: Exploratory analysis to categorize programs into clusters that exhibit similar grading patterns.

### Tools Used

- Python: For all data preprocessing and analysis.
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization.
